# GET1033-Project 
-- Project Proposal --
-- Modified Arduino 3 x 3 LED CUBE with Heart Rate Sensor  --

-- Components --
1. Arduino Uno with Cable
2. Breadboard
3. 27 x 5mm diffused blue LED 
4. 3 x 10k ohm resistor
5. 9 x 220 ohm resistor
6. 3 x NPN transistor
7. Pulsesensor Heart Rate Sensor
8. Wire
9. Laptop for power supply
10. Corrugated board for a base


-- description --
To build an arduino uno microcontroller enabled 3 x 3 LED display cube that responds to stimulus (heart rate) and causes different configurations/speeds/patterns of the flashing LED 

-- design process --
1. Bending of the +ve and -ve terminals of the LEDs
2. Solder the LEDs into a cube formation using corrugated board for a base
3. Connect cube to arduino uno pins
4. Connect stress sensor to araqduino pins
5. Code for LED and stress sensor

-- what does it do --
Gives a visual representation of stress/heart rate, in the form of a flashing led light cube 

-- why --
To be a metaphor for the stress experienced during school life and
